# Mini Frontend Projects

A repository for building small projects that I find interesting. It contains small projects that I build to learn and practice different technologies in the frontend.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository and move into it: 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:fagbenjaenoch/mini-frontend-projects.git
cd mini-frontend-projects
```

2. Install pnpm from [here](https://pnpm.io/installation) or skip if you have it installed already.

3. Run
  ```
  pnpm install
  ```

5. Navigate into the project of your choice and run `pnpm run dev` to start the dev server

6. Go to [localhost](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

# Mini Frontend Projects

A repository for building out my curiosities on the frontend projects. It contains small projects that I build to learn and practice different technologies in the frontend.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository: 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:fagbenjaenoch/mini-frontend-projects.git
```
2. Install pnpm from [here](https://pnpm.io/installation) or skip if you have it installed already.

3. Since this repository contains more than one project, it would be tedious to run `pnpm install` for every single project separately. Instead, you can use the following commands:
- Windows:
```powershell 
.\setup.ps1
```
- Linux and MacOS:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
setup.sh
```

4. Navigate into the project of your choice and run `pnpm run dev` to start the dev server

5. Go to [localhost](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

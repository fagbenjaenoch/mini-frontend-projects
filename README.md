# Mini Frontend Projects

A repository for building out my curiosities on the frontend projects. It contains small projects that I build to learn and practice different technologies in the frontend.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository: 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:fagbenjaenoch/mini-frontend-projects.git
``` 
2. Since this repository contains more than one project, it would be tedious to run `pnpm install` for every single project separately. Instead, you can use the following commands
- Windows:
```powershell 
.\setup.ps
```
- Linux and MacOS:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

3. Navigate into the project of your choice and run `pnpm run dev` to start the dev server

4. Go to [localhost](http://localhost:5173) in your browser
